This is a simple winforms app that converts Excel data to SQL server database.

How to use:
1. You need to have Microsoft SQL server installed to access the converted database.
2.In the app you need to provide:
	- the absolute path of the Excel file that you want to read and convert to a SQL database, so that the program is able to find it. (there is also an option to view the data of the excel file in the app).
	- the database name.
	- the table name inside the database. 

You can convert as many excel files as you want into tables inside the same database (the names of the tables just have to differ inside the same database), or you can create a new database. All by changing the names in the text inputs and clicking the convert button.
